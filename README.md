## Objective of the Project:

Our goal is to help with the Sustainable Development Goal 4 - Quality Education. The objective of STEM curriculum recommendation is to provide educators with guidance and support in selecting and implementing high-quality, effective learning resources that align with their educational goals and the needs of their learners. Hence, the goal of our project is to develop a machine learning model that enables educational content to be matched to specific topics in a curriculum. The machine learning model will be trained on open-sourced K-12 educational materials, organized into a wide variety of topics, in various languages.
